Subject: Fwd: new net threat

Forward for beth:
 More than a thousand hacked Web sites are serving up fake Flash Player
software to users duped into clicking on links in mail that's part of a
massive spam attack masquerading as CNN.com news notifications.

The bogus messages, which claim to be from the CNN.com news Web site,
include links to what are supposedly the day's Top 10 news stories and Top
10 news video clips from the cable network. Clicking on any of those links,
however, brings up a dialog that says an incorrect version of Flash Player
has been detected and that tells users they needed to update to a newer
edition.

One distinguishing feature of the attack is the endless loop it uses to
frustrate victims. If user clicks "Cancel" in the dialog that prompts for an
update, another pop-up appears that tells the victim that they have to
download it to view the video. Clicking "Cancel" the returns the user to the
first dialog.

It puts you in this perpetual loop, so your only options are to kill your
browser session or be browbeaten into installing it.

MX Logic has detected more than 160 million spam messages in the fake
CNN.com attack in the past 48 hours.
